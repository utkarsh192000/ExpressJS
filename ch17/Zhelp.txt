## CONNECT MONGODB using Mongoose 

Mongoose requires a connection to a MongoBD database 

-> connect() - we can connect to a locally hosted database with mongoose.connect()

Syntax: connect(uri,options,callback)

uri- String used as conncetion uri 
options- It is an object passed down to MongoDB driver's connect() Functions 
callback - callback function 

ex: mongoose.connect("mongodb://localhost:27017/schooldb")

// .connect() along with options 

const options={
    useNewUrlParser:true,
    useUnifiedTopology:true,
}
mongoose.connect("mongodb://localhost:27017/schooldb",options);


## IMPORTANT options PROPERTIES 

user- string 
pass - string 
dbname -string 
authSources- string 
autoIndex- bool 


## STEPS :

-> to previous just remember to install ejs and mongoose by commands 
    npm install ejs 
    npm install mongoose 

2) import mongoose 
3) use .connect() method 

NOTE : for demo purpose we can make a database using MONGODB compass , there we create a database and collections 

-> writing the conncetion code in app.js may not be considered a very good practice ; therefore we may create a folder 
    db parallel to app.js , inside that create a connectdb.js file , which will contain the code 





## CONNECTING MONGOOSE TO MONGODB USING AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHERISATION 

1)create user using mongosh
2) go to that database using use schooldb 
3) create user by command 
    db.createUser({ user:'utkarsh',pwd:'123456',roles:[{role:'read',db:'schooldb' } ] } )
4) can see user using show users  
5) but we need to enable the autherisation in mongodb config file 
6) mongodb/5.0/bin and open .cfg file uncomment and in security write authorization: enabled

7) Now we may also pass user , password and other things as OPTIONS in .connect()


NOTE:  if your password contains special character , then we must convert then using percent endcoding
