Controller groups related request handling logic separately.
-> Instead of writing the business logic in routes in app.js and in route file(routes/student.js) ; controller handles the
logic and then just use it 
-> It solves the probem when we have such a big logic , code of thousands line, code becomes messy ;
so controller helps

-> It encorporate the MVC architecture 
-> we just defines the route in these files, the callback or logic is written in separate folder controllers
* inside that we can make different controllers for different modules
