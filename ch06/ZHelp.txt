Routing refers to determining how an application responds to client request at a particular endpoint 
    It may be a URI/path and a specific HTTP request method (such as GET,POST,PUT,DELETE)
    ex /home , /about , /books/yourbook

-> Each route may have one or more callback function , which is executed when route is matched
    SYNTAX:-   app.method(path,callback);
    or
                app.method(path,[callback1,callback2,....]);

->    app is instace of express ; path is path on server ; callback is function which is executed when route is matched











TO START THE APPLICATION MANDATORY STEPS :
                    
1) npm init -y to create package.json
2) create a app.js file to write a code 
3) got  to package.json and set 
    "type":"module"
4) install express 5.0 by
    npm i express@5.0.0-alpha.8 
    you will se it in dependencies
5)  install nodemon as development dependencies by
    npm install -D nodemon
6) go to script in package.json and set
    "dev":"nodemon app"

7)  to run the APPLICATION use 
   nodemon run dev 


// COMMON CODE FOR MOST OF THE APPLICATION


import express from 'express'
// imported express module 


const app=express();
// created a instance of express 

const port= process.env.PORT || '3000';
// set a port ; it will either be taken from env or it will 3000

app.get('/',(req,res)=>{

});



app.listen(port,()=>{
    console.log(`Server is listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
// using .listen() method to run a server at a particluar port 




// WHAT IS ROUTER ??
// Router class is used to create mosular, mountable route handlers
// It is a complete middleware and routing system
//  Every Express app has built in app router 

STEPS:

1) Create Router module ex: routes/student.js
2) create Router instance/object 
 const router=express.Router()
3) Define Routes using router object
   ex:    router.get('/',(req,res)=>{
            res.send("Hello World ");
   });

   -> also export router by 
    module.exports=router

4) got to app.js import it in file by 

    const stu=require('./student.js');

5) load router module thereafter
  app.use('/vidyarthi',stu);


## Path to be followed :
-> We have made a bigger folder named routes in parallel to package.json
-> Inside it there are 2 files named student.js and teacher.js

 -> all student related routing is written /routes/student.js and then it is exported
 -> similarly all teacher related routing is done in /routes/teacher.js and then it is exported
