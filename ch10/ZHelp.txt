### Views contains the HTML served by your APPLICATION and separates application logic from presentation logic 

-> They are stored in views directory 
-> all HTML,CSS , IMAGES fundas are written here 


## Creating views :
-> in /views/index.html , a simple html would be written 

-> create route for View 
    way of writing route also changes after using views 

    app.get('/',(req,res)=>{
        res.sendFile(join(process.ewd(),'views','index.html'));
        // instead of res.send , we would be sending a html page , so use res.sendFile 
        // we get a method join in path module nodejs 
        // from views folder serve index.html
    });
