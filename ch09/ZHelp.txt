TO START THE APPLICATION MANDATORY STEPS and folder division :


                    
1) npm init -y to create package.json

2) got  to package.json and set 
    "type":"module"
3) install express 5.0 by
    npm i express@5.0.0-alpha.8 
    you will se it in dependencies
4)  install nodemon as development dependencies by
    npm install -D nodemon
5) go to script in package.json and set
    "dev":"nodemon app"

6)  to run the APPLICATION use 
   nodemon run dev 

7) create a app.js file to write a code
    -> this would be the entry point of APPLICATION


    
// COMMON CODE FOR MOST OF THE APPLICATION


import express from 'express'
// imported express module 


const app=express();
// created a instance of express 

const port= process.env.PORT || '3000';
// set a port ; it will either be taken from env or it will 3000

app.get('/',(req,res)=>{
    res.send("Hello World");
});



app.listen(port,()=>{
    console.log(`Server is listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
// using .listen() method to run a server at a particluar port 






8) make routes folder where we would be writing different routes for different modules separately 
        -> inside that make files for each module like student.js , teacher.js , subject.js 
        -> write routes for each module in there files separately , 
        -> dont forget to export and import them 
        -> path would be concatenated along with path in app.js 

9) make a controllers folder where we going to write the callback which will be used in routes folder , 
modules.js like ( student.js , teachers.js  )  
 -> remember to save them with same them with some name and export ; so that we can import them in routes/module.js
    and use there
