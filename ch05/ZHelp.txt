Routing refers to determining how an application responds to client request at a particular endpoint 
    It may be a URI/path and a specific HTTP request method (such as GET,POST,PUT,DELETE)
    ex /home , /about , /books/yourbook

-> Each route may have one or more callback function , which is executed when route is matched
    SYNTAX:-   app.method(path,callback);
    or
                app.method(path,[callback1,callback2,....]);

->    app is instace of express ; path is path on server ; callback is function which is executed when route is matched


// HTTP METHOD:

GET- retrieve the data 
POST - create /insert data 
PUT- completely update data 
PATCH - partially update data 
DELETE - delete data  









TO START THE APPLICATION MANDATORY STEPS :
                    
1) npm init -y to create package.json
2) create a app.js file to write a code 
3) got  to package.json and set 
    "type":"module"
4) install express 5.0 by
    npm i express@5.0.0-alpha.8 
    you will se it in dependencies
5)  install nodemon as development dependencies by
    npm install -D nodemon
6) go to script in package.json and set
    "dev":"nodemon app"

7)  to run the APPLICATION use 
   nodemon run dev 


// COMMON CODE FOR MOST OF THE APPLICATION


import express from 'express'
// imported express module 


const app=express();
// created a instance of express 

const port= process.env.PORT || '3000';
// set a port ; it will either be taken from env or it will 3000

app.get('/',(req,res)=>{

});



app.listen(port,()=>{
    console.log(`Server is listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
// using .listen() method to run a server at a particluar port
