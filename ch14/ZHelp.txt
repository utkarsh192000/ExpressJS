## INCLUDE TEMPLATE
-> this concept is used when we make any sub-template and we want to use in every ejs file 
    ex: suppose i want same navbar in both home and about page ; instead of writing the same code in both home and about 
        , we can just write navbar separately and include it in both home and about page 

-> Syntax: <%- include(folder/filename,object)%>
    ex:    <%- include(myfolder/footer,{name:"Harsh"})%>


Convention: A separate folder named as partials or include is made inside the views folder 
-> All the common code in different files , is written here and the included in different files
